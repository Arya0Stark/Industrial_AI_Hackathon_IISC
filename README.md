The first ever industrial AI hackathon and bootcamp in India was organized at PES University by the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) in collaboration with an industry consortium of Flutura, Hydac.

Being one of the shortlisted hundred students to attend, I learnt about Digital twins, AI constructs,Trends in Industrial 4.0, automated anomalous behavor detection,automated asset failure clustering, drone and vision analytics, IoT sensors and controller.
At the end of the bootcamp, we were given a dataset and asked to perform comprehensive data analysis using Flutura's Cerebra Engineer's WorkBench(EWB).

My team and I worked on a dataset of autonomous vehicles where we analysed the crash risk and maneuverability in such vehicles. 
We inspected and looked into the persona, Industrial digital twin canvas, causal map, blueprint canvas and probed and scrutinised the observations from the dataset, attributing them fittingly to the risk and maneuverability analysis with statistics.

Finally we presented our analysis to the panel and pitched our findings.
